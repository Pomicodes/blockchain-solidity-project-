Calldata
When we want to communicate with a smart contract, we send a transaction from an Externally Owned Account. Inside of that transaction is a data property which is commonly referred to as the "calldata". This call data format is the same for calling solidity functions whether it is in a transaction from an EOA or if its in a message call from one contract to another.

The format looks a little like this. Let's say you wanted to call a method approve on a contract, that takes a uint:

function approve(uint val) external;
We can target this function by taking its signature and hashing it with keccak256, then taking the first 4 bytes. So for approve here, it would be the keccak256("approve(uint256)"). The first 4 bytes of the resulting hash is 0xb759f954. This is the first part of our calldata!

Then we need to decide how much we want to approve. What is our val? Let's say it was 15, that would 0xf in hexadecimal. We will need to pad this value out to 256 bits, or 64 hexadecimal characters. The resulting value will be:

000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f
If we combine this with the function signature, our call data would look like this:

0xb759f954000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f
Regardless of whether its in a transaction from an EOA or a message call from one contract to another, this would be our calldata sending 15 to an approve function.
